    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>Effective date: May 8, 2025</p>

    <p>By using the <strong>Next Dash DNS</strong> mobile application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and
        Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. App Description</h2>
    <p>Next Dash DNS is a third-party mobile application that interfaces with the NextDNS public APIs. The app provides
        a user interface to view DNS analytics and configuration data from <a href="https://nextdns.io"
            target="_blank">NextDNS.io</a>.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of NextDNS</h2>
    <p>The App interacts directly with your NextDNS account using your provided token. It displays real-time data and
        allows you to update certain settings (such as profiles, filters, logs, and configurations) based on the options
        you choose within the App.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for your own NextDNS account and any changes made through the App. We recommend verifying any
        changes made via the official NextDNS dashboard if needed.</p>

    <h2>3. User Token</h2>
    <p>The NextDNS token you provide is stored securely on your device only (Encrypted SharedPreferences on Android and
        Keychain on iOS). It is never shared with any third party or stored remotely by the App developer.</p>

    <h2>4. No Warranty</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that it will be error-free or
        uninterrupted. You use the App at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All trademarks and service marks of NextDNS remain the property of their respective owners. This App is not
        affiliated with or endorsed by NextDNS.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify or update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes
        constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, you may contact us at <a
            href="mailto:jesthersilvestre@yahoo.com">jesthersilvestre@yahoo.com</a>.</p>
